# Hi there! 👋

My name is Isra Nebot Dominguez — isrand. I work at IBM in Groningen, The Netherlands as a Senior Blockchain Developer. I love reseraching and developing solutions to problems such as the Poisson Disc Distribution and the N-Queens problem.

## 🌱 Ongoing

* As of Q3 2021 I'm in the process of getting my **Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)** certification. I project to have achieved the certification by the end of the year.

## ✔️ Finished

### September 2021

* The Impossible Fabric : a server / client application pair that reduces the complexity of O(n!) problems to a probability space search problem among a set of peers by generating a trimmed down graph of the n! combinations. I developed it to test a distributed, brute-force algorithm to solving the Complete Queens problem, known to be NP-complete. It is orders of magnitude faster than the classic approach to solving NP-complete problems, especially with big boards (n >= 1000) and few queens (q <= n / 2). Contact me to know more about it! I will be writing a white paper about it soon.

### May 2021
* [A Twitter bot](https://github.com/isrand/HookLineAndClickerInfo) that you can mention in response to a tweet with a clickbaity article headline. The bot will enter the webpage, screenshot its contents and reply to you. No more clickbait, no more ad trackers, more privacy! Use it by mentioning `@HookLineClicker` on Twitter.

### June 2020
* [N-Queens Linear Time Complexity Conflict Checker](https://github.com/isrand/NQueensLinearTimeComplexityConflictChecker) : An algorithm to quickly verify the validity of a N-Queens board either while it's being solved or once it has been solved. It runs in linear complexity time and is especially performing when treating big boards (n >= 1000).

### October 2019
* [A Multi-Layered Map Analysis Approach To Tree Species Distribution In Terrain Generation](https://github.com/isrand/AMultiLayeredMapAnalysisApproachToTreeSpeciesDistributionInTerrainGeneration/blob/master/A%20Multi-Layered%20Map%20Analysis%20Approach%20To%20Tree%20Species%20Distribution%20In%20Terrain%20Generation.pdf) : a research paper in which I explore techinques for realistic terrain generation using the Poisson Disc Distribution algorithm in Unity 3D.
